# logimodule
Its a simple login module using HTML5, CSS, JS, AJAX, PHP<br /><br />

For using this Login Module. <br />
1- Download all of the files into your system.<br />
2- Make sure your system has a framework that supports php like XAMPP, WAMPP, etc.<br />
3- Import the SQL file that I have provided in your MYSQL DB.<br />
4- Hurray!!! You are ready to go, just start the index.php page<br /><br /><br />

Note:-  I haven't included the sessions since it requires a different page & scope for the same.<br />
        The register and login page are on same page. I used JS to byforgate both of them.<br />
        If you want to make redirect into some other page after login/register, then you can change it in the JS page.<br /><br /><br />

Enjoy!!!<br />
