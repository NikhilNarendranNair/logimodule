# logimodule
Its a simple login module using HTML5, CSS, JS, AJAX, PHP

For using this Login Module.
1- Download all of the files into your system.
2- Make sure your system has a framework that supports php like XAMPP, WAMPP, etc.
3- Import the SQL file that I have provided in your MYSQL DB.
4- Hurray!!! You are ready to go, just start the index.php page

Note:-  I haven't included the sessions since it requires a different page & scope for the same.
        The register and login page are on same page. I used JS to byforgate both of them.
        If you want to make redirect into some other page after login/register, then you can change it in the JS page.

Enjoy!!!
